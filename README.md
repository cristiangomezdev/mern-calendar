## Reflection

  - This project was really important to me, to make a standart level of knowledge of how they work.
  - how to create components, how to pass them properties, learn how to make a navigation system, use the main libraries.
  - By doing exactly the same thing in 3 different libraries/framewokrs has helped me a lot in learning the ecosystem of javascript and it's boundaries.
